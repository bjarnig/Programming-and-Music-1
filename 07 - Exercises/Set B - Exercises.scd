/* 1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns
   a dictionary containing statistics about the array: the sum,
   average, minimum, maximum, and count of even and odd numbers. */



/* 2. Write a function that takes a string and returns a new string
   where each word is reversed but the word order remains the same.
   For example, "hello world" becomes "olleh dlrow". */



/* 3. Write a program that generates two arrays of random numbers,
   then creates a new array containing all numbers that appear in
   both arrays (the intersection), without duplicates. */



/* 4. Write a function that takes a number and prints a multiplication
   table for that number from 1 to 10, formatted nicely with labels
   showing each calculation (e.g., "3 x 5 = 15"). */



/* 5. Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns
   a dictionary where keys are the strings and values are arrays
   containing the length of the string and the count of vowels
   in that string. */



/* 6. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns
   a new array where each element is replaced with the sum of all
   previous elements plus itself. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] becomes
   [1, 3, 6, 10]. */



/* 7. Write a function that generates a random word of a specified
   length. The function should take a length and an optional character
   set to choose from. If no character set is provided, use lowercase
   letters. Return the generated word as a string. */



/* 8. Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns
   a dictionary with keys "common", "only_first", and "only_second"
   containing the numbers that appear in both, only in the first,
   and only in the second array respectively. */



/* 9. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns
   a new array where each number is replaced with "small" if it's
   less than 10, "medium" if it's between 10 and 50, and "large"
   if it's greater than 50. */



/* 10. Write a function that takes a string and returns a formatted
     report showing: the original string, reversed string, character
     count, word count, and a dictionary of all unique characters
     with their counts. */
