/* 1. Write a function that takes an array of MIDI note numbers
   and returns a dictionary containing: the lowest pitch, highest
   pitch, average pitch, and the count of notes in each octave
   (octaves are 0-11, 12-23, 24-35, etc.). */



/* 2. Write a function that takes an array of MIDI note numbers and
   a number of semitones, then returns a new array with all notes
   transposed (shifted) by that number of semitones. Positive numbers
   transpose up, negative numbers transpose down. */



/* 3. Write a function that takes an array of durations in seconds
   and a scaling factor, then returns a new array where each duration
   is multiplied by the scaling factor. Also return the total duration
   of the original array and the scaled array. */



/* 4. Write a function that takes an array of amplitude values
   (0.0 to 1.0) and returns a dictionary with: the minimum amplitude,
   maximum amplitude, average amplitude, and a count of how many
   values are in each range (quiet: 0-0.3, medium: 0.3-0.7, loud: 0.7-1.0). */



/* 5. Write a function that takes a starting MIDI note and a number
   of semitones, and returns an array of MIDI notes forming a
   chromatic scale (all semitones) from the starting note. */



/* 6. Write a function that takes an array of frequencies and
   returns a new array containing only the frequencies that are
   within a specific range (e.g., between 200 Hz and 2000 Hz).
   Also return the count of filtered frequencies. */



/* 7. Write a function that takes a root note (MIDI number) and
   returns a dictionary containing arrays of MIDI notes for major
   and minor scales starting from that root. Major scale intervals:
   [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]. Minor scale intervals: [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]. */



/* 8. Write a function that generates a sequence of durations and
   amplitudes. The function should take a count (how many items to
   generate), a base duration, a base amplitude, and a variation range.
   It should return a dictionary with two arrays: one for durations
   and one for amplitudes, where each value varies randomly around
   the base values within the specified range. */



/* 9. Write a function that generates a chord (an array of MIDI notes)
   from a root note. The function should take a root MIDI note and
   a chord type (major or minor). Major chord intervals: [0, 4, 7].
   Minor chord intervals: [0, 3, 7]. Return an array of MIDI notes
   representing the chord. */



/* 10. Write a function that takes an array of MIDI notes and
     returns a formatted report showing: all unique notes (without
     octave), the frequency range in Hz, the pitch range in semitones,
     and a dictionary mapping each note name to how many times it
     appears (regardless of octave). */
