# Programming and Music 1

The course covers programming fundamentals, synthesis, composition,
and interaction approaches. Topics are studied using the SuperCollider
programming environment.

The course starts by going through the basic concepts of programming
and computer science while gradually introducing topics related to
algorithmic composition and sound synthesis.

Finally, interaction processes using graphical user interfaces and external
controllers are studied to create original systems capable of generating
music.
