Exercise 1: Tremolo with Variable Rate
Create a tremolo effect on a sine wave where the tremolo rate itself changes
slowly over time (use an LFO to control the tremolo rate).


Exercise 2: Amplitude Modulation Exploration
Create an AM synthesis patch where both the carrier frequency (300-600 Hz) and
modulator frequency (50-300 Hz) are controlled by separate LFNoise generators.
Use freqscope to observe the sidebands.


Exercise 3: Ring Modulation with Envelopes
Create a ring modulated sound that uses envelopes on both the carrier and modulator
frequencies. The sound should have a clear attack and decay lasting about 2 seconds.


Exercise 4: FM Bell Sound
Create an FM bell-like sound using a carrier frequency of 440 Hz and a modulator
ratio of 1.4. The modulation index should start at 10 and decay to 0 over 3 seconds.
Add an amplitude envelope as well.


Exercise 5: Complex FM with Multiple Operators
Create an FM patch with at least 3 operators (3 sine oscillators where some modulate
others). Experiment with different carrier:modulator ratios to create interesting
harmonic and inharmonic sounds.
