Exercise 1: Lag for Smooth Transitions
Create a patch where a sawtooth oscillator's frequency jumps randomly between
values (use LFNoise0), then apply Lag to smooth out the transitions. Compare
the sound with and without Lag.


Exercise 2: Sample and Hold Melody
Create a simple melody using sample and hold (Latch or TRand). Use a trigger
rate of 4-8 Hz and choose frequencies from a pentatonic scale or array of pitches.


Exercise 3: Waveshaping Comparison
Create three versions of the same sine wave (200 Hz) with different amounts of
drive (multiply by 2-4), then apply clip2, fold2, and wrap2 to each version.
Listen to the differences in timbre.


Exercise 4: Lo-Fi Effect
Create a lo-fi/bitcrusher effect by combining sample rate reduction (using Latch)
and bit depth reduction (using round). Apply this to a sawtooth or complex waveform.
Use MouseX and MouseY to control the parameters.


Exercise 5: Complex Shaping Chain
Create a patch that combines at least three different shaping techniques:
- Start with a complex source (multiple oscillators or filtered noise)
- Apply Lag or VarLag for smoothing
- Add waveshaping (fold, clip, or wrap)
- Include sample and hold or quantization
